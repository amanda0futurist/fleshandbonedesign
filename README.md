# fleshandbonedesign
This is the design for a cover band website. I wanted it to look really simple, but the kind
of wbsite design I like can give people the impression that is dated and they wonder if the
band is still around. So maybe I should make it look more up to date? I'll try to do that 
by making it less static and having more motion and transitions.
